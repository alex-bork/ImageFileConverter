# XS Image File Converter

This is an image converter that converts a file of specific format into another.
The current implementation does not support conversion of multiple files. Because of that I call the program "Really Small Image File Converter", that is why the prefix XS is for.  
Maybe one day I will have time to make it "bigger". :-)
